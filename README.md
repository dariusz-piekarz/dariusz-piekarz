- 👋 Hi, I’m @dariusz-piekarz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, C and C++ and combination of those languages. In particular, in creation of new libraries and modules (Python, C, C++), boosting by different methods (concurrency, C API, pybind11, async).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning asynchronous programming in Python, and exploring more advanced concepts than basics in C/C++ (like concurrency, mappings etc.). Still a lot to learn, but feel excited as this is finally my cup of tea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects. One day I would like to try also Go language.
