- 👋 Hi, I’m @dariusz-piekarz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, C and C++ and combination of those languages. In partcular in creation of new libraries and modules (Python, C, C++), boosting by different methods
   (cocurrency, C API, pybind11, asyc).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning asynchronous programming in Python, and exploring a bit more advanced concepts than basics in C/C++ (like cocurrency, mappings etc.). Still a lot to learn, but feel excited
     as this is the finally my cup of tea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challanging projects conneced to Django/Flask, GUI, API, multiprocessing/ multithreading, Cython, C API, pybind11 projects, as well as any data science projects
      and anything that allows me to gain new knowledge in Programing. One day I would like to try also Go language.
