- 👋 Hi, I’m @dariusz-piekarz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, C and C++ and combination of those languages. In particular, in creation of new libraries and modules (Python, C, C++), boosting by different methods (concurrency, C API, pybind11, async).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning asynchronous programming in Python, and exploring more advanced concepts than basics in C/C++ (like concurrency, mappings etc.). Still a lot to learn, but feel excited as this is finally my cup of tea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects connected to Django/Flask, GUI, API, multiprocessing/multithreading, Cython, C API, pybind11 projects, as well as any data science projects and anything that allows me to gain new knowledge in Programming. One day I would like to try also Go language.

- ⚡ Fun fact: A 3-dimensional Euclidean ball can be decomposed into 5 pieces so that, using only translations and rotations, two identical balls of the same size (volume) can be constructed.
